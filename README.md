# Hi, I’m Jacob Johnson

I’m a Senior Product Designer who builds **end-to-end platforms** — from the consumer experience to the business tools behind it. I’ve spent 12+ years at Carsforsale.com designing both the car-shopping side and the dealer software that powers inventory, CRM, and lead management.

## What I’m into

- **Product design**: consumer + B2B web apps, complex systems, dashboards, and workflows  
- **Code**: front-end implementation and prototypes, currently building my portfolio in custom code with Cursor  
- **AI tooling**: using modern AI tools for everything from exploration and prototyping to production workflows  
- **Fun stuff**: gaming, esports, and Formula 1

## Currently

- 🌱 Exploring ways to combine AI with product design and front-end development  
- 🧰 Working on a lawn care web app (cool-season lawn planning and maintenance)  
- 🎨 Building a new portfolio for `jacobjohnson.net`

## Collaborating

I’m most interested in projects that sit at the intersection of **product design and front-end engineering**—especially complex web apps, dashboards, or platforms where design and implementation are tightly connected.
